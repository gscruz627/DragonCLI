---

### Game Loop and UI

- Menus are controlled using `while` loops.
- The screen is cleared using:
  ```csharp
  Console.Clear();
  Console.WriteLine("\x1b[3J");
  ```
### Time Features
- Wait timers are implemented using the `DateTime` class
- Used for: Breeding, hatching, growing crops, upgrades, building
  
### Game Functionality
- When the game starts, we check for a save file on the users's AppData folder, if it does not exist, we create one
- As starter, we give the user a habitat and a dragon
- `Dragons` can be discovered, bred, fed and removed
- `Eggs` can be obtained thorugh purchasing or breeding and placed on the Hatchery
- `Habitats` generate gold depending on the dragons and their level
- `Farms` can be purchased from the store and grow crops
